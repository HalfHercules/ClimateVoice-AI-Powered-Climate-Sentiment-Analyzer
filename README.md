# ClimateVoice-AI-Powered-Climate-Sentiment-Analyzer
AI tool for SDG 13. Analyzes X post sentiments on climate using BERT, clusters them by region, and suggests local actions (e.g., tree planting) via a Google Cloud web app. Empowers communities with data-driven climate solutions.

Climate change is a pressing global issue, but public awareness and actionable steps often lag due to misinformation, lack of engagement, or overwhelming data. People express their thoughts on social media (like X), but these sentiments are rarely harnessed to drive localized climate action.

ClimateVoice" is an AI/ML-powered tool that
Analyzes real-time sentiments about climate change from X posts in specific geographic regions.
Uses natural language processing (NLP) to categorize sentiments (e.g., concern, denial, apathy) and identify key topics (e.g., deforestation, emissions).
Pairs this analysis with a recommendation engine that suggests tailored, community-specific climate actions (e.g., tree planting in deforested areas, reducing energy use in high-emission zones) based on open climate datasets.
Visualizes the data and recommendations on an interactive web app for individuals, policymakers, and organizations.
Why It Stands Out:

Combines NLP for social media sentiment analysis with a practical action-oriented output.
Integrates real-time X data with climate datasets, making it dynamic and region-specific.
Addresses both awareness (via sentiment insights) and action (via recommendations), aligning with SDG 13’s call for urgent climate measures.
Scalable for global use but hyper-localized in its outputs.
Tech Stack:

AI/ML: NLP with transformers (e.g., BERT), clustering (e.g., K-Means), and recommendation algorithms.
Data Sources: X API for posts, open climate datasets (e.g., NASA’s GISS, World Bank Climate Data).
Frontend: Google Cloud for hosting, Flask/Django for the web app, Google Maps API for visualization.
Uniqueness: Real-time social media integration + actionable outputs.
Implementation Outline
Data Collection:
Use the X API to scrape posts containing climate-related keywords (e.g., "climate change," "global warming").
Pull climate data (e.g., CO2 emissions, deforestation rates) from public APIs.
Sentiment Analysis:
Preprocess X posts (remove noise, tokenize).
Use a pre-trained BERT model to classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) and extract topics.
Clustering:
Apply K-Means clustering to group similar sentiments and topics by region.
Recommendation Engine:
Build a rule-based or ML-based recommender that matches sentiment clusters to climate actions (e.g., high "concern" about emissions → suggest renewable energy adoption).
Visualization:
Create a web app showing a heat map of sentiments and a list of recommended actions per region.
Deployment:
Host on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability and use Google’s tools (e.g., Firebase) for real-time updates.
